    "For this game we will use the most basic unit from each team, the Marine and the Zergling. The base cost of a marine is 1 supply and 50 minerals, the base cost of a Zergling is .5 supply and 25 minerals, as such 1 marine equates to 2 Zerglins in terms of cost of units."

    "The initial board would be set up based on the number of zergs, marines and the size of the board, however there was an issue where instead of the zergs and marines spawning on individual cells it was putting them on top of eachother, so I had to restrict this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each turn of the game invloves all units making an action, movement, retreat, or attack. The first of these was movement and retreat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial plan was for the units to have movement in any direction based off their move-speed, however this was too larger a branching factor and as such it was reduced to forward movement and backwards movement (Retreat) however this was still too much and the final approach was to have forward movement as standard and the retreat movement in certain scenarios only.\n",
    "Marines since there is less of them have the retreat movement available all the time and reduced movement when an enemy is within attack range."

    "Movement is also restricted to if the cell is free, there was also an issue with the Zergling units not behaving as expected due to the need to have the enemy unit be exactly their movement speed away, this was resolved by adding a charging movement to melee units (uses units with attack range of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with movement was that if a zerg got behind the marines or a marine got behind the zerglings, there was no possible moves other than retreat to get in range. As such the forward movement was changed to be based on direction of nearest enemy. This function first used Manhattan distance, later Euclidean distance was implemented throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final issue occured that when there was only 1 unit left in each team, they would only have the possiblity to retreat but the unit might be above or below them. as such a case for when a unit is the last on their team they get the initial omnidirectional of movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attacks have two modes, Melee attacks and Ranged attacks, Melee units have the charging feature above that allows them to get into melee range, any unit can attack in melee range, including ranged units. If a unit is in melee range it cannot retreat and must attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranged units can attack enemies in range, first Manhatthan distance was used but to better get the diagonal attack possibilities, Euclidean distance was used instead. When a unit is in attack range it is added to the attackable targets for that unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a units hp reaches 0 it is removed from the board. One issue that came up with the unit HP is that due to the generation of children with deepcopy, the boards units are copied and as such the unit couldn't be retreived directly from the attack target, as such the targets x and y was used to apply the damage to th correct unit at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the current state of the board was crucial for this project, this evaluation is based on two things, unit HP and distance from enemy units.\n",
    "These two parameters are added as variables to the current board: health_weight, positioning_weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is evaluated for each unit and thus a team score is created, the zerg score is taken away from the marine score, thus a high value is beneficial to the marines and a lower value is beneficial to the zergs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation function is used in the min_max function to find the next best move for the current team making a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some issues with the development of this function, at first I had another variable of potential attack, this was removed since it wasn't positively effecting the evaluation. I also considered tracking the % of initial units, but this would invlove tracking the starting units given at the begining of the game, and would add complexity with child generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue I had was that during the evaluation of the positioning, I originally tryed to make it based on position to the centre of the board, however this sometimes gave a divison by zero error if the unit was in the centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/division_error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was replaced with manhattan distance to enemy units, and then this was replaced with Euclidean distance in the final itteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branching factor for this project was quite large since each unit has multiple possible actions, particularly at the begining when the units are all alive and none are in combat range since combat reduces the possible moves the initial stages of the game require a large branching factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible moves per turn are culmiated in the function get_team_possible_actions() which returns all the possible moves for the team for that turn. This went through some itterations as well but the main feature of it was to ensure that unique scenarios were created, to do so I used the line:\n",
    "        return list(set(tuple(combo) for combo in product(*team_unit_actions)))\n",
    "This requires the import of: from itertools import product\n",
    "\n",

    "As stated in the board discussion, just getting the baord to work and the game to function took many itterations, the cases where game pieces ended up in areas where no move could be possible is one itteration not mentioned previously.\n",

    "This occured when one itteration of possible actions did not have a default move possibility, this was resolved with the retreat function which allowed retreat or stay still as a last resort.\n",

    "One key itteration was about the movement of the zerglings, even though their intention was to surround the enemy, if they were allowed to retreat, they would always keep one going back to keep the overall hp of the team higher, however this meant that the marines were able to pick off the zergs one by one each time, removal of this allowed retreat for the zergs was a key point to their epected behavior.\n",

    "The entirety of this project has been spent trying to get the board and evaluation working correctly, and the main focus has been around choosing the correct movement patterns and attack options for units, this went through many itterations especially in terms of reducing branching factor and checking the expected behavior of the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the search tree to effectively choose a move that would be beneficial is an interesting concept for any baord game, the objective of the evaluation is the act of checking all possible moves x steps in the future and picking the one that would be most beneficial to the player at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting occurrence is that in the desired game board of 8 zergs and 4 marines, there is the possibility of a draw conidtion, where one unit of each remains."

    "Possible further improvements not explored, is the previously mentioned evaluation weighting based on percent of units remaining. This should improve win rates of the marines, since losing a unit is not the same as losing hp on multiple units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the weighting is just based on unit hp, therefore the score is not proportional to the overall team, rather just a summation of the units hp multiplied by the weighting factor."
